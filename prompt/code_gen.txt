I would like to create an ingest script to load my data into Neo4j. I already have an empty Neo4j database ready. 
* Use uv to manage this project 
* The CSV data is located in data/
* The validated data model we are using for this graph is data_model/data_model.json
* The database connection credentials are in a .env file. Look at the .env.example file for reference.
* the yaml config file is called pyneoinstance_config.yaml

I would like to use the following libraries to accomplish this
* pyneoinstance
* pandas

Use the latest version of each library please.
