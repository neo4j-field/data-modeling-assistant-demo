Please use the following context and the provided sample data to generate a new graph data model.

Here is the data context:
## Data Summary  * Accounts (25 records): Mix of customers and prospects across various industries (Technology, Healthcare, Manufacturing, etc.) with realistic revenue ranges and employee counts * Contacts (31 records): Associated with accounts, including realistic titles, contact information, and lead sources * Leads (20 records): Potential customers at various stages (Open, Working, Qualified) with industry and revenue data * Opportunities (30 records): Sales deals ranging from $95K to $1.85M across different stages of the sales pipeline, linked to both accounts and some converted leads * Cases (30 records): Support tickets with various priorities and types (Problems, Feature Requests, Training, etc.)  ## Key Features for Analytics  1. Realistic relationships - Contacts belong to accounts, opportunities reference both accounts and leads 2. Varied data points - Different industries, revenue ranges, deal sizes, and geographic locations 3. Time-based data - Creation dates, close dates, and activity dates for trend analysis 4. Status tracking - Various stages for leads, opportunities, and cases 5. Consistent naming - Professional company names, realistic contact information  ## Analytics Opportunities  * Sales pipeline analysis by stage and probability * Lead conversion rates by source and owner * Account performance by industry and size * Case volume and resolution time analysis * Geographic distribution of customers and prospects * Revenue forecasting based on opportunity pipeline * Performance tracking by sales rep/owner

Here are the use cases:
What accounts have open support tickets and does this put them at risk if they have active opportunities? Which case owner should be assigned to a new case? Let's take into account familiar accounts and the industry.

Additional Instructions:
* Ensure that if you know the source information for Properties, you include it in the data model.
* If you deviate from the user's requests, you must clearly explain why you did so.
* Only use data from the provided sample data to create the data model (Unless explicitly stated otherwise).
* If the user requests use cases that are outside the scope of the provided sample data, you should explain why you cannot create a data model for those use cases.

Process:
1. Analysis
    1a. Analyze the sample data 
    1b. Use the `list_example_data_models` tool to check if there are any relevant examples that you can use to guide your data model
    1c. Use the `get_example_data_model` tool to get any relevant example data models
2. Generation
    2a. Generate a new data model based on your analysis, the provided context and any examples
    2b. Use the `get_mermaid_config_str` tool to validate the data model and get a Mermaid visualization configuration
    2c. If necessary, correct any validation errors and repeat step 2b
3. Final Response
    3a. Show the user the visualization with Mermaid, if possible 
    3b. Explain the data model and any gaps between the requested use cases
    3c. Request feedback from the user (remember that data modeling is an iterative process)
