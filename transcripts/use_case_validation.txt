Now that we've populated our Neo4j graph with our Salesforce data, please validate that it addresses our use cases.
What accounts have open support tickets and does this put them at risk if they have active opportunities? Which case owner should be assigned to a new case? Let's take into account familiar accounts and the industry.

I'll help you validate that your Neo4j graph addresses your use cases by examining the current data structure and then writing queries to answer your specific questions. Let me start by understanding what's in your graph.

Great! I can see your Neo4j graph has all the key Salesforce entities and relationships. Now let me analyze your specific use cases:

Use Case 1: Accounts with open support tickets and their risk assessment
Let me find accounts that have open support tickets and check if they have active opportunities:

Now let me get more details about the specific cases and their priorities:

Use Case 2: Case Owner Assignment Based on Familiarity and Industry
Now let me analyze case ownership patterns by industry to help with assignment decisions:

Let me also check case owner workload and performance:

Perfect! Now I can provide you with a comprehensive analysis of how well your Neo4j graph addresses your use cases:

‚úÖ Use Case Validation Results
Your Neo4j graph successfully addresses both critical use cases. Here's what I found:

üö® High-Risk Accounts (Open Tickets + Active Opportunities)
Critical Risk Accounts (require immediate attention):

BioPharma Research ($2.57M in opportunities) - High-priority compliance case with Jennifer Lee
Financial Partners LLC ($2.14M opportunities) - High-priority SSO implementation with Anna Thompson
MediaStream Networks ($1.54M opportunities) - Medium-priority mobile compatibility issue
RetailMax Stores ($1.10M opportunities) - ESCALATED POS integration issue with Lisa Wang
Key Risk Indicators:

16 accounts have both open support tickets AND active opportunities
Combined opportunity value at risk: $13.7M+
4 accounts have "Hot" rating with high-priority cases
1 case is already escalated (RetailMax Stores)

üìä Case Assignment Recommendations
For New Case Assignment, Consider:

Workload Balance:

Available capacity: Michelle Davis, Kevin Brown, Eric Johnson (0 open cases)
Moderate load: Most owners have 1 open case
High load: Emily Rodriguez (2 open cases, 1 critical)
Industry Expertise Mapping:

Technology: 4 specialists (Sarah Johnson, Rachel Green, Maria Garcia, Daniel Kim)
Healthcare: 2 specialists (Emily Rodriguez - overloaded, Lauren White - available)
Financial Services: 2 specialists (Anna Thompson, Nicole Adams)
Retail: 2 specialists (Lisa Wang, Amanda Chen)
Recommended Assignment Logic:

cypher
// For a new Technology case, prefer available tech specialists
MATCH (owner:CaseOwner)<-[:ASSIGNED_TO]-(c:Case)<-[:HAS_CASE]-(a:Account)
WHERE a.industry = 'Technology'
WITH owner, count(CASE WHEN c.status <> 'Closed' THEN 1 END) as workload
ORDER BY workload ASC
RETURN owner.name, workload
üéØ Validation Summary
‚úÖ Your graph successfully enables:

Risk identification - Easy to spot accounts with open tickets and active deals
Workload balancing - Clear visibility into case owner capacity
Industry expertise - Track which owners handle which industries
Account familiarity - See which owners have history with specific accounts
üí° Recommendations for new case assignment:

Healthcare cases ‚Üí Lauren White (Emily Rodriguez overloaded)
Technology cases ‚Üí Daniel Kim or Maria Garcia (lowest current workload)
New industries ‚Üí Michelle Davis, Kevin Brown, or Eric Johnson (available capacity)
Would you like me to create specific Cypher queries for automated case assignment based on these criteria, or dive deeper into any particular aspect of the analysis?

can you please package these validation queries you ran into a yaml file?

I'll package all the validation queries I ran into a well-structured YAML file for you.Neo4j Salesforce Validation QueriesCode¬†# Neo4j Salesforce Data Validation Queries
# These queries validate that the graph addresses key use cases for support and sales operations

metadata:
  title: "Salesforce Neo4j Graph Validation Queries"
  description: "Comprehensive queries to validI've created a comprehensive YAML file containing all the validation queries I ran, plus some additional operational queries that would be useful for ongoing management of your Salesforce Neo4j graph.
The YAML file includes:
üîç Core Validation Queries:

Risk assessment queries for accounts with open tickets and active opportunities
Case owner expertise and workload analysis for optimal assignment
Detailed case and opportunity analysis

‚ö° Operational Queries:

Critical cases requiring immediate attention
Optimal case assignment recommendations by industry
Account health dashboard with risk categorization

üìã Structure:

Metadata with use case descriptions
Categorized queries with priority levels
Expected outputs for each query
Usage instructions and business outcomes

Key Features:

Parameterized queries (like $industry for case assignment)
Priority levels (critical, high, medium, low)
Categories (risk_assessment, case_assignment, operations, dashboard)
Clear documentation for each query's purpose

You can use this YAML file to:

Validate your implementation by running these queries regularly
Monitor system health with the dashboard queries
Automate case assignment using the recommendation queries
Create alerts for high-risk accounts or critical cases

Would you like me to modify any of the queries or add additional validation scenarios?
