⏺ I'll help you create an ingest script to load your data into Neo4j.
  Let me first examine your project structure and understand what data
   and configuration you have.

⏺ List(~/Documents/projects/data-modeling-assistant-demo)
  ⎿  Listed 25 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(.env.example)

⏺ Read(ingest_config.yaml)
  ⎿  Read 244 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(pyproject.toml)
  ⎿  Read 8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now I'll create the Neo4j ingest script. Based on the project
  structure and configuration files, I can see you have:

  1. CSV data files with CRM data (accounts, contacts, cases,
  opportunities, leads)
  2. A comprehensive data model JSON structure
  3. An existing YAML configuration file with Cypher queries
  4. A uv-managed Python project

⏺ Write(ingest.py)
  ⎿  Wrote 371 lines to ingest.py                                    
     #!/usr/bin/env python3
     """
     Neo4j Data Ingest Script
     This script loads CRM data from CSV files into Neo4j using the 
     data model
     and configuration specified in ingest_config.yaml and 
     data_model/data_model.json.
     Usage:
         python ingest.py
     … +361 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now I need to update the pyproject.toml to include the required
  dependencies:

⏺ Update(pyproject.toml)
  ⎿  Updated pyproject.toml with 5 additions and 1 removal         
        4    description = "This project demonstrates how to use 
            the Neo4j Data Modeling MCP server to assist in 
            modeling relational data as a graph and ingesting into 
            a Neo4j database."
        5    readme = "README.md"
        6    requires-python = ">=3.10"
        7 -  dependencies = []
        7 +  dependencies = [
        8 +      "neo4j>=5.0.0",
        9 +      "python-dotenv>=0.19.0",
       10 +      "pyyaml>=6.0.0"
       11 +  ]

⏺ Now let's install the dependencies and test the script:

⏺ Bash(uv sync)
  ⎿  Resolved 5 packages in 1.10s 
     Installed 4 packages in 16ms
      + neo4j==5.28.2
     … +3 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let's check if you have a .env file and create one if needed:

⏺ Bash(ls -la .env*)
  ⎿ -rw-r--r--@ 1 alexandergilmore  staff  100 Aug 27 12:42 .env     
    -rw-r--r--@ 1 alexandergilmore  staff  100 Aug 27 12:42 .env.exam
    ple


⏺ Good! You already have a .env file. Let's do a dry run test of the
  script to check for any syntax errors:

⏺ Bash(uv run python -m py_compile ingest.py)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Great! The syntax is valid. Now let's test the script's ability to
  load configuration and connect to the database (this will fail if
  Neo4j isn't running, but that's expected):

⏺ Bash(uv run python -c "
      from ingest import Neo4jIngest…)
  ⎿  ✓ Configuration loaded successfully
     ✓ Environment variables loaded
     ✓ YAML configuration parsed
     … +9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I've successfully created a comprehensive Neo4j ingest
  script for your CRM data. Here's what I've delivered:

  Created Files:

  ingest.py - A complete Python script that:
  - Loads your CSV data from the data/ directory
  - Uses your existing ingest_config.yaml configuration
  - Connects to Neo4j using credentials from your .env file
  - Creates all necessary constraints and indexes
  - Loads nodes (Account, Contact, Case, Opportunity, Lead, CaseOwner)
  - Creates relationships between entities
  - Includes comprehensive logging and error handling
  - Provides data verification after import

  Updated pyproject.toml - Added required dependencies:
  - neo4j>=5.0.0 - Neo4j Python driver
  - python-dotenv>=0.19.0 - Environment variable management
  - pyyaml>=6.0.0 - YAML configuration parsing

  Key Features:

  - Type conversion: Automatically converts dates, numbers, and
  strings
  - Batch processing: Handles large datasets efficiently
  - Error handling: Comprehensive logging and graceful error recovery
  - Data validation: Verifies all data was loaded correctly
  - Case owner handling: Creates unique CaseOwner nodes from
  Case_Owner names
  - Relationship mapping: Links all entities according to your data
  model

  To use the script:

  1. Ensure your Neo4j database is running
  2. Verify your .env file has the correct credentials
  3. Run: uv run python ingest.py

  The script will create a detailed log in ingest.log and provide
  console output showing progress and final verification counts.

⏺ I see there's an issue with the script when trying to create
  indexes. Let me fix this error:

  ⎿  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(ingest.py)
  ⎿  Read 25 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The issue is that the indexes section in your YAML config is
  empty/commented out, so indexes is None. Let me fix this:

⏺ Update(ingest.py)
  ⎿  Updated ingest.py with 5 additions and 1 removal             
       114        def create_indexes(self):
       115            """Create database indexes."""
       116            self.logger.info("Creating database 
             indexes...")
       117 -          indexes = 
           -  self.config.get('initializing_queries', 
           -  {}).get('indexes', [])
       117 +          indexes = 
           +  self.config.get('initializing_queries', 
           +  {}).get('indexes', []) or []
       118            
       119 +          if not indexes:
       120 +              self.logger.info("No indexes to create")
       121 +              return

       125                    self.run_query(index)

⏺ Now let's test the script again:

⏺ Bash(uv run python ingest.py)
  ⎿ 2025-08-27 13:36:40,682 - INFO - Loaded configuration from ingest

⏺ Perfect! The ingest script ran successfully. Let me fix the
  deprecation warning about using the driver after it's closed:

⏺ Update(ingest.py)
  ⎿  Updated ingest.py with 2 removals                            
       327            except Exception as e:
       328                self.logger.error(f"Data ingest failed:

       329                raise

             basic queries."""

⏺ Update(ingest.py)
  ⎿  Updated ingest.py with 4 additions

       369 +      finally:
       370 +          if ingest and ingest.driver:
       371 +              ingest.driver.close()
       372            
       373        return 0
       374    

⏺ Excellent! Your Neo4j ingest script has successfully loaded all your
   CRM data into the database. Here's a summary of what was
  accomplished:

  ✅ Successfully Loaded:

  - 25 Accounts - Company/customer records
  - 31 Contacts - Individual people associated with accounts
  - 30 Cases - Support cases and tickets
  - 30 Opportunities - Sales opportunities
  - 20 Leads - Potential customers
  - 25 Case Owners - Unique support team members

  ✅ Relationships Created:

  - 31 BELONGS_TO_ACCOUNT - Contacts linked to their companies
  - 30 HAS_CASE - Accounts linked to their support cases
  - 30 REPORTED_BY - Cases linked to reporting contacts
  - 26 HAS_OPPORTUNITY - Accounts with sales opportunities (4
  opportunities don't have matching accounts)
  - 30 ASSIGNED_TO - Cases assigned to case owners

  The script properly handled:
  - Data type conversions (dates, numbers, strings)
  - Creation of derived entities (CaseOwner nodes from case owner
  names)
  - Error handling and logging
  - Database constraints and validation

  Your CRM graph database is now ready for queries! You can use Neo4j
  Browser or any Cypher client to explore the relationships between
  accounts, contacts, cases, opportunities, and leads.
